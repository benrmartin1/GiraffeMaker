# Giraffe Generator 

Unity project which generates a giraffe, gives it a fun name, and lets you explore a small map with it while collecting food. This is mostly a practice project to mess around in Unity and learn how to make simple animations and try out the terrain editor.

All dimensions of the giraffe are autogenerated (length/height of body, tail, head, etc), and the pieces always fit together nicely because of cool maths. Once you've picked a giraffe and taken lots of screenshots of it to show your friends, you can press enter to try it out in the playground map. 

As you walk around your personal giraffe animates using amazing animations by me. Once you collect enough food, you unlock jumping and then shooting, which are typical giraffe skills.

I wrote the code and created the terrain. I also created the "models" and "animations" for the giraffes. Don't look too closely. Art, such as the food models and fonts, are taken from the internet and Unity asset store. Music by Komiku from [here](https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/).
