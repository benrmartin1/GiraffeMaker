Features left to implement - 
1. Switching between different grounds (rock, terrain, no ground for 2D mode)
2. Switching between skyboxes (maybe tied to ground?)
3. Physics mode - Add Rigidbody to giraffes:
   a. Drop mode/place mode
   b. Tilt the ground (only rock ground?)
   c. Max number of giraffes / infinite toggle
4. Better name UI (sign hanging down from top of screen)
5. Display controls (before? on screen?)
