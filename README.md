# Giraffe Generator 

Unity project which generates a giraffe and gives it a fun name. All dimensions of the giraffe are autogenerated (length/height of body, tail, head, etc), and the pieces always fit together nicely because of cool maths. Once finished, you can press enter to try out your giraffe in the playground. As you walk around your personal giraffe animates using amazing animations by me.

Features left to implement - 

1. Physics mode - Add Rigidbody to giraffes:
   a. Drop mode/place mode
   b. Tilt the ground (only rock ground?)
   c. Max number of giraffes / infinite toggle

2. Display controls (before? on screen?)
